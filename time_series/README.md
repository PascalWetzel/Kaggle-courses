Apply machine learning to real-world forecasting tasks.

1. [Linear Regression With Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/linear-regression-with-time-series)  
Use two features unique to time series: lags and time steps.

2. [Trend](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/trend)  
Model long-term changes with moving averages and the time dummy.

3. [Seasonality](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/seasonality)  
Create indicators and Fourier features to capture periodic change.

4. [Time Series as Features](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/time-series-as-features)  
Predict the future from the past with a lag embedding.

5. [Hybrid Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/hybrid-models)  
Combine the strengths of two forecasters with this powerful technique.

6. [Forecasting With Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/forecasting-with-machine-learning)
