Use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

1. [A Single Neuron](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/a-single-neuron)  
Learn about linear units, the building blocks of deep learning.

2. [Deep Neural Networks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/deep-neural-networks)  
Add hidden layers to your network to uncover complex relationships.

3. [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/stochastic-gradient-descent)  
Use Keras and Tensorflow to train your first neural network.

4. [Overfitting and Underfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/overfitting-and-underfitting)  
Improve performance with extra capacity or early stopping.

5. [Dropout and Batch Normalization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/dropout-and-batch-normalization)  
Add these special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.

6. [Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/binary-classification)  
Apply deep learning to another common task.
